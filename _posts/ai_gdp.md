_[Satya claimed](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/satya-nadella?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&timestamp=986.7) (at ~16:30-17:30) we'll know AI is successful when we see a 10% increase in yearly GDP. Is this possible? What have other technologies achieved?_


Sure, it’s possible. But I’ll try to show that nothing like that has happened before. First, global GDP in 2024 was [~$110T](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD) so the target is going to be at least $11T of LLM-driven growth in a single year. Said another way, that would be roughly the combined economies of Japan, France, and the United Kingdom.

The internet now accounts for ~15% of global GDP and that took ~35 years(commercial internet rough start date was 1991). During that period, growth rates in many large economies are healthy but not >10%. So even if the internet accounted for ALL economic growth during a year, it was never that big.

GLP1 Agonists are very new and a very big deal. They went from just launched as a product in October 2017 to around $50B for 2024(~0.045% of Global GDP). By comparison, OpenAI is on track to hit $10B in 2025 and my best guess is that accounts for 50% of the “LLM sector”’s direct revenue. So there’s some upper and lower bounds for GDP Growth Rate impact of specific technologies.

What impact did the first and second industrial revolution have on GDP? We don’t have good estimates from either period. The best estimates come from economic historians who model growth as roughly flat at just above zero prior to the First Industrial Revolution(circa 1760-1840) for countries that adopted the technology and then 1-3% growth after adoption began.

And the second one? Estimates here have more data around them but I think the error bars are still large enough to only talk in generalities. It was maybe in the roughly 1-5% range with the exception of the US which saw multiple >10% growth periods. I don’t think the Second Industrial Revolution by itself was driving the majority of the growth in the US though.

Quick aside: Here are two charts, one is for the United Kingdom in the Second Industrial Revolution(1870-1914), and the other is time-shifted forward a hundred years(1970-2014). Can you guess which is which?

So this all points to 10+% gdp growth on a large scale being an unprecedented outcome. 

What’s likely? I have no idea, but I think LLMs can be hugely successful without causing a global GDP growth rate of 10+%.
